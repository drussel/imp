//! Ensure that a set of particles remains connected with one another.
/** The restraint implements ambiguous connectivity. That is, it takes
    several particles and ensures that they remain
    connected, but allows how they are connected to change. If you wish
    to restraint the connectivity of sets of
    particles (i.e. each protein is represented using a set of balls)
    use an appropriate PairScore which calls a Refiner (such
    as ClosePairsPairScore).

    \verbinclude connectivity_restraint.py

    More precisely, the restraint scores by computing the MST on the complete
    graph connecting all the particles. The edge weights are given by
    the value of the PairScore for the two endpoints of the edge.
