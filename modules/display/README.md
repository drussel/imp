This module provides code to write various file formats for displaying data
from IMP modeling efforts. The IMP::display::Writer classes provides the base class for objects which write to specific file formats and the IMP::display::Geometry provide means of describing geometry. Currently it supports output to
 - Pymol via the IMP::display::PymolWriter
 .
And display of boxes, points, spheres, segments, ellipsoids are supported.

You should probably check out IMP::rmf for a more general file format and one that is read natively by both IMP and Chimera.
