/**\page rmf RMF Files

The %RMF file format (short for Rich Molecular Format) stores hierarchical data about a molecular
structure in a binary file. This data can include

- molecular structures stored hierarchically. These structures need not be atomic resolution.

- feature information about parts
of the structures, such as how well it fits a particular
measurement.

- geometric markup such as segments, surfaces, balls,
colors which can be used to improve visualization

For example, a protein can be stored as a hierarchy where the root
is the whole molecule. The root has one node per chain, each chain
has one node per residue and each residue one node per atom. Each
node in the hierarchy has the appropriate data stored along with
it: a chain node has the chain identifier, and a residue
node has the type of the residue stored and atom nodes have coordinates,
atom type and elements. Bonds between atoms are stored explicity.

The file might also include a feature node storing the r-value for a
FRET measurement between two residues as well as extra markers to highlight
key parts of the molecule.

Multiple conformations on the hierarchy are stored as frames.
Each frame has the same hierarchical structure, but some aspects of
the data (eg coordinates) can have one value for each frame (or no
value for a particle frame if they happen not be be applicable
then).

A hierarchical storage format was chose since
- most biological molecules have a natural hierarchical structure
- it reduces redundancy (eg the residue type is only stored once, as is the residue index)
- most software uses a hierarchy of some sort to represent structures at runtime, so less translation is needed
- low resolution and multiresolution structures are then more natural as they are just truncations of a full, atomic hierarchy.

See \internal{simple.xml, simple.rmf} for an XML dump of the %RMF generated from
\internal{simple.pdb.txt, simple.pdb}. For a larger example, see
 \internal{3O3Y.xml, 3O3Y.rmf} from \internal{3O3Y.pdb.txt, 3O3Y.pdb}. Note,
that viewing XML files works much better with \external{http://www.mozilla.org/firefox, Firefox}
\external{http://chrome.google.com/, Google Chrome} than with Safari. For more
information about the library see RMF. And for the standard data storage schemes see
\ref categories "standard categories".

\section structure 1 The RMF Hierarchy
R
More technically, each node in the %RMF hierarchy has

- a type (RMF::NodeType)

- a human readable name (RMF::NodeHandle::get_name()

- an ID that is unique within the file
  (RMF::NodeHandle::get_id())

- and associated attributes.

Each attribute is identified by a key (RMF::Key) and is
defined by a unique combination of
- a \ref rmf_types "type".

- a \ref category "category" such as \ref catphysics "physics", identified by
an RMF::CategoryD.

- a name string

On a per %RMF basis, the data associated with a given key can either
have one value for each node which has that attribute, or one value
per frame per node with the attribute. The methods in
RMF::NodeHandle to get and set the attributes take an optional
frame number.

A number of data categories and attributes have been defined so
far. New ones can be added as needed, without affecting existing
files. See the documentation for each \ref categories "category" for more
information:
- \ref catphysics "physics",
- \ref catsequence "sequence",
- \ref catshape "shape",
- \ref catfeature "feature",
- \ref catpublication "publication",
- \ref catbond "bond".

In addition, arbitrary data can be associated with sets of Nodes.
This mechanism is used to store bond information (which is always stored
in the file to avoid the difficulties associated with parsing PDB files).
Information about bond angles or torsion angles could be stored
using the same mechanism. Currently, the library API supports sets up to
size 4, but we can add arbitrary sized sets when needed.

\section adding 2 Adding custom data to an RMF

When adding data to an %RMF file that is just to be used for
internal consumption, one should create a new category. For
example, \imp defines an ''imp'' category when arbitrary particle
data is stored.

If, instead, the data is likely to be a general interest, it
probably makes sense to add it to the documentation of this library
so that the names used can be standardized.


\section rmf_hdf5 3 RMF and HDF5

The %RMF data is stored in a single
\external{http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/UG/UG_frame09Groups.html,HDF5
group} in the file on disk. As a result, one could easily put
multiple %RMF "files" in a single HDF5 archive, as well as store
other data (such as electron density maps).  However, adding extra
data sets within the %RMF HDF5 group is not supported.

HDF5 was chosen over the other candidates as it
  - supports binary i/o, avoiding issues parsing and delimiters that occur with text files
  - supports random access, allowing loading of individual conformations without reading the who file
  - can use internal compression to reduce the size of files
  - has well developed support library facilitating easy use from most programming languages and has a variety of command line tools to aid debugging

\note The following information about how the data is stored on disk
is not complete. Implementers should instead use the API provided in the RMF library.

The %RMF data is spread over various data sets, divided up into classes based on
the RMF::Category, data type and whether the particular attribute
has one value per frame or just one for the whole file and whether the data
is for one one or a sets of nodes. Each node
has space allocated where it can store information about whether it
has attributes in a given class, and if so, where in the corresponding
data set the attributes are stored.

Space is allocated in the appropriate table if an attribute in a particular
class is used in a node. A special marker value
is used to signify when a particular attribute in a class is not found for a
particular node (e.g. a -1 is used to signify that a node does not
have an index attribute).

To get any idea of the data layout in a file, see the dump (produced by
 \c h5dump) of a tiny %RMF, \internal{simple.hdf5.txt, simple.rmf}. For a larger
example, see \internal{3O3Y.hdf5.txt, 3O3Y.rmf}.
