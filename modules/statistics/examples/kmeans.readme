Clustering is very simple. The example generates some random points in
clusters and extracts the clusters. To cluster density, configurations
or particles, replace the IMP.statistics.Vector3DEmbedding with a
IMP.statistics.Vector3DEmbedding with a
IMP::statistics::HighDensityEmbedding,
IMP::statistics::ConfigurationSetXYZEmbedding or a
IMP::statistics::ParticleEmbedding.
