This module provides code to compute statistical measures. Data to be clustered
is represented one of two ways, either with an
IMP::statistics::Embedding or a IMP::statistics::Metric. The
representation is then passed to an algorithm that returns a
clustering object such as an IMP::statistics::PartitionalClustering.
