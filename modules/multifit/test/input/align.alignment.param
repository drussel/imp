#### connectivity parameters:
#conn upper_bound k max_conn_val
#upper_bound used to define the connectivity restraint
#k used to define the connectivity restraint
#max_conn_va maximum value for the restraint, used for filters
#0.0236 corresponds to 5A std, 0.3 corresponds to 1 STD, 1.18 to 2 STD

#### xlink parameters:
#xlink upper_bound k max_xlink_val treat_between_residues
#max_xlink_val: maximum value for crosslinked residue restraint
#treat between residues: if set to 1 the restraint is between the residues, if set to 0 the restraint is between the proteins, like a connectivity restraint
xlink 20 0.0236 0.3 0
#### radius of gyration parameters
#rog scale max_score
#note: these restraints are only relevant if a coarse representation of a protein is used
#scale: allow the radius of gyration of the particles to be at most scale times the predicted one
#max_score: maximum value allowed for a radius of gyration restraint applied on each protein seperatly

#### filter parameters
#filters conn_max_violations, xlink_max_violations, ev_max_violations
# conn_max_violations: if more than X connectivity restraints exceed their maximum score the solution is removed
# xlink_max_violations: if more than X xlink restraints exceed their maximum score the solution is removed
# ev_max_violations: if more than X pairwise excluded volume restraints exceed their maximum score the solution is removed

#### excluded volume parameters
#ev pair_distance pair_slack hlb_mean hlb_k maximum_ev_score_for_pair scoring_mode
#distance ev restraint works on a pairs contains that includes all paris within the distance
#pair_slack the container will be recalculate if the distance between one of the pairs changes more than slack
#hlb_mean use harmonic lower bound, meaning that if the distance between a pair between the proteins is lower than mean the score is 0
#hlb_k  used for the harmonic calculation on each pair (0.5*k*(d-mean)*(d-mean)), k of 0.59 means 1 STD
#maximum_ev_score_for_pair_of_sphere:  the EV score is divided by the number of pairs BETWEEN the two proteins 
#allowed_percentrage_of_bad_pairs: The max score allowed will be maximum_ev_score_for_pair_of_sphere*total_num_of_pairs*allowed_percentrage_of_bad_pairs                                                                     
#scoring_mode: 0 means no ev will be calculated, 1 means ev between all pairs will be calculated, 2 means ev only between selected
#pairs (as noted in the proteasomice file) will be calculated (0.3 means 1 STD is allowed, which in our
#case means that penetration of up to 1 A is ok).
