This module implements a protocol for generating atomic structures of complexes
with cyclic symmetry (such as rings), using only the atomic structure of a
single subunit and a cryo-electron microscopy density map of the complex.
See the IMP::multifit module for a similar protocol for handling non-symmetric
complexes.

Generally, this module is not used directly; instead, the
\ref application_cnmultifit_tools "cnmultifit.py application" is used.
