                 overview="""This modules provides support for RMF file format
                 for storing hierarchical molecular data (such as atomic
                 or coarse grained representations of proteins), along with
                 markup, including geometry and score data.

 IMP.rmf supports I/O of IMP::atom::Hierarchy and associated types as
 well as output of IMP::display::Geometry, IMP::Restraint and
 arbitrary IMP::Particles. These work by having an \c add_X() method
 which adds the object to the file and then \c set_frame() methods can
 set the ith frame of the object from the objects current
 state. Similarly, there are \c create_Xs and \c load_frame() methods
 which create an object of the type in question and load the data from
 the corresponding frame into already created objects.

   See the ::RMF library page for more information.
