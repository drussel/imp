                 brief="This module provides RMF I/O for \imp.",
                 overview="""This modules provides support for RMF file format
                 for storing hierarchical molecular data (such as atomic
                 or coarse grained representations of proteins), along with
                 markup, including geometry and score data. The format uses
                 the hdf5 library to manage the data on disk.


                 \section contents Contents
                 The module provides code for general purpose I/O of such data,
                 designed to be used in other packages (we have not yet separated
                 it out into a separate library), along with \imp specific code.
                 Accordingly, support is provided at three different levels, in
                 order of increasing generality:

-# The \imp layer: supports I/O of IMP::atom::Hierarchy and associated
   types as well as output of IMP::display::Geometry, IMP::Restraint and arbitrary IMP::Particles. These
   work by having an \c add_X() method which adds the object to the file and then
   \c set_frame() methods can set the ith frame of the object from the objects current
   state. Similarly, there are \c create_Xs and \c load_frame() methods which create
   an object of the type in question and load the data from the corresponding frame
   into already created objects.
-# The hierarchy layer: supports general traversal of the encoded hierarchy
   and addition and reading of arbitrary hierarchical data. This layer primarily
   consists of IMP::rmf::RootHandle and IMP::rmf::NodeHandle. It is designed
   to be used by programs to traverse the file while they create their own data
   structures.
-# The HDF5 layer: provides a C++ interface to access the raw HDF5 file.
   This layer consists of IMP::rmf::HDF5DataSet and IMP::rmf::HDF5Group along
   with the IMP::rmf::HDF5Handle and type traits classes. It acts as a more useful,
   but limited, replacement for the HDF5 C++ bindings.

   \section assoc Associations
   The RMF wrapper has the concept of an association between nodes in its hierarchy
   and objects in the program accessing. Such association is used in \imp too,
   for example, map between particles and the nodes on disk saving data for that
   particle. This association can only be set once each time the file is open,
   trying to reset is an error. It is set either when an object is added to the file
   eg IMP::rmf::add_hierarchies() or when explicitly requested,
   eg IMP::rmf::set_hierarchies().

   \section bins Helper programs

   See the \\ref application_rmf_tools "RMF tools" application for helper programs.

   \section ff RMF Files
   The RMF file format stores a hierarchy of data in an HDF5 node. Each node in the RMF
   hierarchy has a type (IMP::rmf::NodeType), a name (IMP::rmf::NodeHandle::get_name(),
   an ID (IMP::rmf::NodeHandle::get_id()) that is unique within the file,
   and associated attributes. Each attribute is identified by a key (IMP::rmf::Key) and
   consists of a unique combination of a type, category (IMP::rmf::KeyCategory) and name
   (IMP::rmf::RootHandle::get_name(IMP::rmf::Key). On a per RMF basis, the data stored under a given
   key can either have
   one value for each node which has that attribute, or one value per frame per node with
   the attribute. The methods in IMP::rmf::NodeHandle to get and set the attributes take
   an optional frame number.

   A number of data categories and values have been defined so far. New ones can be added as needed,
   without affecting existing files. See the documentation for each data type for more information:
   IMP::rmf::Physics, IMP::rmf::Sequence, IMP::rmf::Shape, IMP::rmf::Feature.

   In addition, there are bonds associated with the root of the hierarchy. Bonds are identified by a pair of IMP::rmf::NodeHandles.


   \section rmf_hdf5 RMF and HDF5
   The RMF data is stored in a single HDF Group. As a result, one could easily put multiple RMF
   "files" in a single HDF5 archive, as well as store other data in the archive (such as
   electron density maps) along with the RMF data.
