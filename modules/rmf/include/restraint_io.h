/** \name Restraint I/O
    Restraint I/O is quite limited as it is not practical to write enough
    information to the file to recreate actual IMP::Restraint objects
    at the moment. Instead, all that is written is the name, the particles
    used and the score. Restraints that can be decomposed are then
    decomposed and their the decomposed restraints are written as children.
    When the decomposition changes from frame to frame (eg restraints on
    IMP::container::ClosePairContainer containers), the list of particles
    will be empty for frames where that bit of the decomposed restraint
    is not found.
