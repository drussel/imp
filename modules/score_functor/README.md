The module provides composable functors to implement scores via compile-time composition. Currently, there is support for distance based IMP::PairScore types generated from the IMP::scoring_function::DistanceScore and IMP::scoring_function::DistancePairScore. Angles and others can be added if desired.

\note No functionality is exported to python. It can be done with some work, but it
is not clear that it would be very useful.
