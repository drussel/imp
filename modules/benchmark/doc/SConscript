flute.ucsf.edu.  The results are displayed normalized against the
fastest runtime in each set (with a few exceptions, noted below).
Each benchmark is shown first in a "fast" build and second in a
"release" build with checks disabled to give an idea of the speed
comparison. The benchmark source codes can be found in the bin
directory of the benchmark module.

See the \\ref benchmarkr "Benchmark Results" page for historical
benchmark results.
