When the Google PerfTools are found, that profiler is linked in and its functionality exposed to python. This allows profiling of \imp C++ code on non-Mac OS enviroments (Mac OS users should use the Instruments program that comes as part of the developer tools for a much simpler and friendlier solution).

See the \\ref benchmarkr "Benchmark Results" page for historical
benchmark results.
