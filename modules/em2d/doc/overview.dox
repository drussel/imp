/** \namespace IMP::em2d
\brief This module provides functionality to use two-dimensional EM images as restraints
    \nosubgrouping


                    This module allows to use restraints coming from EM class averages.
                    The main class is EM2DRestraint, that you can add to any of your models. This class in turn uses internally the Fine2DRegistraitionRestraint.
                    Don't use the later one directly. Another interesting class is RegistrationResult,
                    that stores all the information obtained after matching a projection with the EM image.
                    And of course Image, which manages the EM images. Finally, we provide a number of
                    routines for image processing, like alignment, filtering or morphological operations.

                    The module goes together with the EModel2D application, that uses the EM2DRestraint for
                    modeling of macromolecular assemblies using class averages. The algorithm is described
                    in the paper:

                    xxx (Not yet) xxx

                    As a side note, the class Image has a header that is specific for EM images, but if you
                    don't care for that information, you can use the class to deal with any sort of
                    image, not only EM.

                    The module works with OpenCV 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. We haven't tried with newer versions yet.
