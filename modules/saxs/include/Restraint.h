//! Calculate score based on fit to SAXS profile
/** \ingroup exp_restraint

    The restraint takes rigid bodies into account, in order
    to speed up the calculations. Rigid body should be gived as single
    RigidBody Particle. Other, non-rigid body Particles can also be given.

    The shape of a rigid body is assumed to be defined by the set of
    atom::Hierarchy leaves of the atom::Hierarchy rooted at the rigid body
    particle.

    \par Algorithmic details:
    The distances between the atoms of rigid body do not change, therefore
    their contribution to the profile is pre-computed and stored.
