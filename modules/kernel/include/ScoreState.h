//! ScoreStates maintian invariants in the Model.
/** ScoreStates allow actions to be taken before and after the restraint
    evaluation process. Such code can be used to, for example:
    - log the optimization process
    - maintain constraints (see Constraint)

    ScoreStates have two methods which are called during
    the Model::evaluate() function
    - before_evaluate() which is allowed to change the contents of
    containers and the value of attributes of particles and
    - after_evaluate() which can change particle derivatives

    The Model uses information that the ScoreState reports about
    its input and output containers and particles to determine a safe
    order in which all the ScoreState objects registered in the model
    can be applied. That is, the Model will ensure that a ScoreState
    that has Particle \c A in its output list is applied before a
    ScoreState that has \c A in its input list.
    For ScoreState::before_evaluate(), Input and output lists are
    returned by the respective get_input_* and get_output_* calls.
    For ScoreState::after_evaluate() they are reversed (see note below).


    \note If no acceptable order exists, an exception will be thrown
    and the set of ScoreState objects creating the loop will be
    reported.

    \note The input and output sets for the ScoreState::after_evaluate()
    functions are assumed to be the reverse of the ScoreState::before_evaluate()
    functions. As a result, the ScoreStates are applied in opposite order
    after evaluate. If you have a ScoreState for which this is not true,
    consider splitting it into two parts.
