//!  A restraint is a term in an \imp ScoringFunction.
/**
    \note Restraints will print a warning message if they are destroyed
    without ever having been added to a model as this is an easy mistake
    to make. To disable this warning for a particular restraint, call
    set_was_used(true).

To implement a new restraint, just implement the two methods:
- IMP::Restraint::do_add_score_and_derivatives()
  (or IMP::Restraint::unprotected_evaluate())
- IMP::ModelObject::do_get_inputs();
and use the macro to handle IMP::base::Object
- IMP_OBJECT_METHODS()

    \note When logging is VERBOSE, restraints should print enough information
    in evaluate to reproduce the the entire flow of data in evaluate. When
    logging is TERSE the restraint should print out only a constant number of
    lines per evaluate call.

    \note Physical restraints should use the units of kcal/mol for restraint
    values and kcal/mol/A for derivatives.

    When implementing an expensive restraint it makes sense to support early
    abort of evaluation if the user is only interested in good scores or scores
    below a threshold. To do this, look at the fields of the ScoreAccumulator
    object such as
    - ScoreAccumulator::get_is_evaluate_if_below(),
    - ScoreAccumulator::get_is_evaluate_if_good()
    - ScoreAccumulator::get_maximum()

    See IMP::example::ExampleRestraint for an example.
