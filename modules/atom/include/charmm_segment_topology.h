//! The topology of a complete CHARMM model.
/** This defines all of the segments (chains) in the model as
    CHARMMSegmentTopology objects, which in turn define the list of residues,
    the atoms in each residue, and their types and the connectivity
    between them.

    A CHARMMTopology object can be created manually, in which case add_segment()
    can be called to add individual CHARMMSegmentTopology objects. In this way
    a new topology can be created, e.g. from protein primary sequence.

    Alternatively, given an existing Hierarchy, e.g. as returned from
    read_pdb(), CHARMMParameters::create_topology() can be called to generate
    a new topology that corresponds to the primary sequence of the Hierarchy.

    A new topology can be patched (apply_default_patches() or
    CHARMMPatch::apply()) to modify the simple chain of residues to
    account for modified residues, C- or N-termini special cases, disulfide
    bridges, etc.

    Once a topology is created, it can be used to generate new particles
    which conform to that topology (create_hierarchy()), or to add
    topology information to an existing Hierarchy (e.g. add_atom_types(),
    add_bonds(), add_charges()).

      Parameters for the bonds (ideal bond length, force constant) are
      extracted from the CHARMM parameter file, using the types of each atom
      (add_atom_types() must be called first, or the particles otherwise
      manually typed using CHARMMAtom::set_charmm_type()).

      If no parameters are defined for a given bond, the bond is created
      with zero stiffness, such that the bond can still be excluded from
      nonbonded interactions but BondSingletonScore will not score it.

      Note that typically CHARMM defines bonds and impropers
      (see add_impropers()) but angles and dihedrals are auto-generated from
      the existing bond graph (see CHARMMParameters::create_angles() and
      CHARMMParameters::create_dihedrals()).

      The list of newly-created Bond particles can be passed to a
      StereochemistryPairFilter to exclude bonded particles from nonbonded
      interactions, or to a BondSingletonScore to score each bond.
