Shows how to locally refine a fit of a protein inside
its density using a MC/CG optimization protocol.
This example does not necessarily converges to the global minimum
as that may require more optimization steps.
If one wishes to use this example as a template for real refinement purposes,
please adjust the parameters of the function IMP.em.local_rigid_fitting
accordingly.
