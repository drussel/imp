\section i1 Introduction

EM is an IMP module that provides basic utilities for handling 2D and 3D density data \imp. 
Main functionalities are:
 -# Reading and writing various density map formats such as XPLOR, MRC, EM, SPIDIER.
 -# Simulating density maps of particles, support particles of all radii and mass
 -# Calculating cross-correlation scores between a density map and a set of particles.
