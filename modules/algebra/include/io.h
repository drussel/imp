/** @name Simple geometric IO
    These functions write geometry to text files, one line per
    geometric primitive. Each line has the form \quote{x y z} for points or
    \quote{x y z r} for spheres. We can easily add general dimension support
    if requested..
    Lines beginning with "#" are treated as comments.
