At the moment, domino will be more efficient if non-bonded lists involving rigid bodies are set up in a particular way. To see the issue and understand the solution, imagine with have two rigid helices and a non-bonded lists consisting of all of the atoms in the two helices. If you create a non-bonded list in the normal way, domino will decompose it in to a large number of pair scores between the atoms, one score for each pair of atoms that can come close together. If, instead you follow the example, a single score term is created which dynamically figures out which atoms are close together and just scores the pair of rigid bodies based on them.
