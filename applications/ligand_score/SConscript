    - protein_ligand_pose_score.lib for use when one wants to find the
    most near-native poses of a ligand from many geometry decoys of the
    same ligand
    - protein_ligand_rank_score.lib for use when screening a compound database
    against a single protein to choose putative binders.

    The rank score is used by default.

    They are both located in the IMP.atom data directory. This directory is
    available within \imp python scripts via the IMP::atom::get_data_path() function.
    From the command line, the files can be found at \c build/data/atom if \imp
    is not installed or something like \c /usr/share/imp/data/atom if it is installed.""",
