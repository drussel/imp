   Several helper programs are provided. They all take the name of the RMF file as
   the first argument and an argument "-f" which is the frame to act on. Negative
   values for the frame are treated as every nth frame. That is, "-f -2" means take
   every other frame.

   - \c rmf_display outputs an arbitrary
   hdf5 file to pymol or chimera as appropriate (based on the file name of the
   second argument). It supports hierarchies, restraints and geometry.

   - \c rmf_pdb converts an rmf file to or from a PDB file, assuming all hierarchies
   in the rmf file are atomic resolution.

   - \c rmf_color adds color information to an RMF
