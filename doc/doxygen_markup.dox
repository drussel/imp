/** \defgroup python Python

\imp relies on \external{www.python.org,Python} for its high-level interface,
scripting, and integration with other packages such as Modeller. The test cases
are also implemented as Python classes that derive from the standard Python
\c unittest module.

Some \imp modules, classes or methods are implemented purely in Python.
