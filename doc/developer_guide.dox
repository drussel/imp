\section gettingaround 1. Getting around

The input files in the \imp directory are structured as follows:
- \c tools contains various command line utilities for use by developers. They are \ref scripts "documented below".
- \c doc contains inputs for general \imp overview documentation (such as this page), as well as configuration scripts for \c doxygen.
- \c applications contains various applications implementing using a variety of \imp modules.
- \c kernel and the subdirectories of \c module/ each defines a module and have the same structure. The directory for module \c name has
   the following structure
   - \c include contains the C++ header files
   - \c src contains the C++ source files
   - \c bin contains C++ source files each of which is built into an executable
   - \c pyext contains files defining the Python interface to the module as well as Python source files (in \c pyext/src)
   - \c test contains test files. When \c scons \c test or \c scons \c name-test is run each file in this directory named \c test_ is executed (after being built if it is a .cpp file) 
   - \c doc contains the overview documentation for the file (in the \c SConscript file) as well as any other documentation that is provided via \c .dox files
   - \c examples contains examples, in Python as well as any data needed for examples
   - \c data contains any data files needed by the module

When \imp is built, the \c build directory is created and filled with
the results of the build. \c build contains a number of
subdirectories. They are
 - \c include which includes all the headers. The headers for the \c kernel are placed in \c include/IMP and those for module \c name are placed in \c include/IMP/name
 - \c lib where the C++ and Python libraries are placed. Module \c name is built into a C++ library \c lib/libimp_name.so (or \c .dylib on a mac) and a Python library
   with Python files located in \c lib/IMP/name and the binary part in \c lib/_IMP_name.so.
 - \c doc where the html documentation is placed in \c doc/html and the examples in \c doc/examples with a subdirectory for each module
 - \c data where each module gets a subdirectory for its data.

Unfortunately, various intermediate files from the build are scattered throughout the \c module
and \c kernel hierarchies. This messiness is part of the reason we strongly recommend doing an
\ref devbuild "out of source build".

When \imp is installed, the structure from the \c build directory is moved over more or less intact except that the C++ and Python libraries are put in the (different) appropriate locations.


\section usage Writing new functions and classes

The easiest way to start writing new functions and classes is to
create a new module using the \ref make_module "make-module script".
This creates a new module in the \c modules directory, complete with
%example code.

We highly recommend using a revision control system such as
\svn or \external{http://git-scm.com/,
GIT} to keep track of changes to your module.

If, instead, you choose to add code to an existing module you need to
consult with the person who people who control that module. Their names
can be found on the module main page.

When designing the interface for your new code, you should

- search \imp for similar functionality and, if there is any, adapt
  the existing interface for your purposes. For %example, the existing
  IMP::atom::read_pdb() and IMP::atom::write_pdb() functions provide
  templates that should be used for the design of any functions that
  create particles from a file or write particles to a file. Since
  IMP::atom::BondDecorator, IMP::algebra::Segment3D and
  IMP::display::Geometry all use methods like
  IMP::algebra::Segment3D::get_point() to access the
  endpoints of a segment, any new object which defines similar
  point-based geometry should do likewise.

- think about how other people are likely to use the code. For
  %example, not all molecular hierarchies have atoms as their leaves,
  so make sure your code searches for arbitrary
  IMP::core::XYZDecorator particles rather than atoms if you only care
  about the geometry.

- look for easy ways of splitting the functionality into pieces. It
  generally makes sense, for %example, to split selection of the
  particles from the action taken on them, either by accepting a
  IMP::ParticleRefiner, or a IMP::SingletonContainer or just an arbitrary
  IMP::Particles object.


You may want to read \ref design_example "the design example" for
some suggestions on how to go about implementing your functionality
in \imp.



\section module Managing your own module

When there is a significant group of new functionality, a new set of authors, or
code that is dependent on a new external dependency, it is probably a good
idea to put that code in its own module. To create a new module, run the
\ref make_module "make_module" script from the main \imp source directory,
passing the name of your new module. The module name should consist of lower
case characters and numbers and the name should not start with a number. In addition
the name "local" is special and is reserved to modules that are internal to code
for handling a particular biological system or application. eg
\code
./tools/make_module mymodule
\endcode

The script adds a number of example classes to the new module, which can be read and
deleted.

The next step is to update the information about the module stored in
\c modules/mymodule/doc/SConscript. This includes the names of the authors and
descriptions of what the module is supposed to do.

If the module makes use of external libraries, you can add code to check for the
external library to \c modules/mymodule/SConscript. Add a check for a library
called \c libextern.so (or \c libextern.dylib on a mac) which is accessed using
the header \c extern.h, using a function call \c call_extern(1.0)
- make sure the \c SConscript includes
\code import scons_tools.checks
\endcode
- then add the check with
\code scons_tools.checks.add_external_library(env, "Extern", "extern", "extern.h",
body="call_extern(1.0);")
\endcode
- if the library requires that other libraries be linked in also, you can add the arguments
\code extra_libs=["first_required_library", "second_required_library"]

That adds a check for the library. To use it in your module, you need to decide if it
is required or not. If it is required, add the argument
\code required_dependencies=["Extern"]
\endcode
to the \c env.IMPModuleBuild call. This will make it so that your module is only built if
the library is found. If the library is optional, instead add
\code optional_dependencies=["Extern"]
\endcode
When writing C++ code that depends on extern, surround it with
\code #if defined(IMP_MODULENAME_USE_EXTERN)
some code using extern
#endif
\endcode
And when writing Python code check if \c IMP.mymodule.use_extern is \c True.

Each module has an auto-generated header called \c modulename_config.h. This header
contains basic definitions needed for the module and should be included (first) in each
header file in the module. In addition, there is a header \c module_version.h which
contains the version info as preprocessor symbols. This should not be included in
module headers or cpp files as doing so will force frequent recompilations.

\section testing Debugging and testing your code

Ensuring that your code is correct can be very difficult, so \imp
provides a number of tools to help you out.

The first set are assert-style macros:

- IMP_USAGE_CHECK() which should be used to check that arguments to
  functions and methods satisfy the preconditions.

- IMP_INTERNAL_CHECK() which should be used to verify internal state
  and return values to make sure they satisfy pre and post-conditions.

See \ref assert "Error reporting/checking" page for more details. As a
general guideline, any improper usage to produce at least a warning
all return values should be checked by such code.

The second is logging macros such as:

- IMP_LOG() which allows controlled display of messages about what the
  code is doing. See \ref log "logging" for more information.

Finally, each module has a set of unit tests. These are Python scripts
which test the behavior of a particular piece of the module's API. The
scripts are located in the \c modules/modulename/test directory.
These tests should try, as much as possible to provide independent
verification of the correctness of the C++ code. The command
\command{scons test} or \command{scons modulename-test} run all modules unit
tests or only those for the module \c modulename, respectively. Any
file in that directory or a subdirectory whose name matches \c
test_*.py is considered a test. The Python files are scanned for
classes which inherit from \c IMP.test.TestCase. For each such class
found, any method whose name starts with \c test_ is run.

Some tests will require input files or temporary files. Input files
should be placed in a directory called \c input in the \c test
directory. The test script should then call
\command{self.get_input_file_name(file_name)} to get the true path to
the file. Likewise, appropriate names for temporary files should be
found by calling
\command{self.get_tmp_file_name(file_name)}. Temporary files will be
located in \c build/tmp. The test should remove temporary files after
using them.


\section codingconventions Coding conventions

Make sure you read the \ref conventions "API conventions" page
first.

To ensure code consistency and readability, certain conventions
must be adhered to when writing code for \imp. Some of these
conventions are automatically checked for by source control before
allowing a new commit, and can also be checked yourself in new
code by running \command{scons standards}

\subsection indent Indentation

All C++ headers and code should be indented in 'Linux' style, with
2-space indents. Do not use tabs. This is roughly the output of
Artistic Style run like
\command{astyle --convert-tabs --style=linux --indent=spaces=2 --unpad=paren --pad=oper}.
Split lines if necessary to ensure that no line is longer than 80
characters.

    \b Rationale: Different users have different-sized windows or
    terminals, and different tab settings, but everybody can read 80
    column output without tabs.

    All Python code should conform to the
    \external{http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/, Python style guide}.
    In essence this
    translates to 4-space indents, no tabs, and similar class, method
    and variable naming to the C++ code. You can ensure that your
    Python code is correctly indented by using the
    \command{tools/reindent.py} script, available as part of the \imp
    distribution.

    \subsection names Names

    See the names section of the \ref conventions "IMP conventions" page.
    In addition, developers should be aware that
    - all preprocessor symbols (things created by \#define) must begin with \c IMP
      and no \imp code should depend on preprocessor symbols which do not
      start with IMP.
    - names of files that implement a single class should be named for that
      class; for %example the SpecialVector class could be implemented in
      \c SpecialVector.h and \c SpecialVector.cpp
    - files that provide free functions or macros should be given names
      \c separated_by_underscores, for %example \c container_macros.h
    - Functions which take a parameter which has units should have the
      unit as part of the function name, for %example
      IMP::atom::SimulationParameters::set_maximum_time_step_in_femtoseconds().
      Remember the Mars orbiter. The exception to this is distance
      and force numbers which should always be in angstroms and
      kcal/mol angstrom respectively unless otherwise stated.
    .
    \b Rationale: This makes it easier to tell between class names and
    function names where this is ambiguous (particularly an issue with
    the Python interface). The Python guys also mandate CamelCase for
    their class names, so this avoids any need to rename classes
    between C++ and Python to ensure clean Python code. Good naming is
    especially important with preprocessor symbols since these have
    file scope and so can change the meaning of other people's code.

\subsection datastorage Passing and storing data

- When a class or function takes a set of particles which are expected to
  be those of a particular type of decorator, it should take a list of
  decorators instead. eg IMP::core::transform() takes a IMP::core::XYZ.
  This makes it clearer what attributes the particle is required to have
  as well as allows functions to be overloaded (so there can be an
  IMP::core::transform() which takes IMP::core::RigidBody particles instead).


- IMP::Restraint and IMP::ScoreState classes should generally use a
      IMP::SingletonContainer (or other type of Container) to store the set of
      IMP::Particle objects that they act on.

- Store collections of IMP::Object-derived
  objects of type \c Name using a \c Names. Declare functions that
  accept them to take a \c NamesTemp (\c Names is a \c NamesTemp). \c
  Names are reference counted (see IMP::RefCounted for details), \c
  NamesTemp are not. Store collections of particles using a
  \c Particles object, rather than decorators.

\subsection display Display

All classes must have a \c show method which takes an optional 
\c std::ostream and prints information about the object (see IMP::Object::show() for an example). The helper
macros, such as IMP_RESTRAINT() define such a method.  In addition they
must have \c operator<< defined. This can be easily done using the
IMP_OUTPUT_OPERATOR() macro once the show method is defined. Note that
\c operator<< writes human readable information. Add a \c write method
if you want to provide output that can be read back in.


\subsection errors Errors

Classes and methods should use \imp exceptions to report errors. See
IMP::Exception for a list of existing exceptions. See
\ref assert "a list of functions to aid in error reporting and detection".


\subsection internal_ns Namespaces

Use the provided \c IMPMODULE_BEGIN_NAMESPACE,
	  \c IMPMODULE_END_NAMESPACE, \c IMPMODULE_BEGIN_INTERNAL_NAMESPACE 
	  and \c IMPMODULE_END_INTERNAL_NAMESPACE macros to put declarations 
	  in a namespace appropriate for module \c MODULE.

Each module has an internal namespace, \c module_name::internal and an internal
include directory \c modulename/internal. Any function which is
 - not intended to be part of the API,
 - not documented,
 - liable to change without notice,
 - or not tested

should be declared in an internal header and placed in the internal namespace.

The functionality in such internal headers is
 - not exported to Python
 - and not part of of documented API

As a result, such functions do not need to obey all the coding conventions
(but we recommend that they do).



\section docs Documenting your code

\imp is documented using \doxygen. See
\external{http://www.doxygen.nl/docblocks.html, documenting source code with doxygen}
to get started. We use \c //! and \c /** ... * / blocks for documentation.

Python code should provide Python doc strings.

All headers not in internal directories are parsed through \doxygen. Any function that
you do not want documented (for %example, because it is not well tested), hide by surrounding
with
\code
#ifndef IMP_DOXYGEN
void messy_poorly_thought_out_function();
#endif
\endcode

We provide a number of extra Doxygen commands to aid in producing nice
\imp documentation. The commands are used by writing \c \\commandname{args}
or \c \\commandname if there are no arguments.

- When you want to specify some command-line command do
    \verbatim
    \command{the command text}\endverbatim
    which produces
    \command{the command text}
    
- To produce a link to a page on the Sali lab web site do
    \verbatim
    \salilab{imp, the IMP project}\endverbatim
    which produces
    \salilab{imp, the IMP project}

- To produce a link to the outside world do
    \verbatim
    \external{http://boost.org, Boost}\endverbatim
    produces \external{http://boost.org, Boost}

- When writing the name \imp do
    \verbatim
    \imp\endverbatim
    so that no link is produced (\imp as opposed to IMP).

- Sections of documentation that are only for people developing \imp code should
  be marked with
  \verbatim
  \advanceddoc You can tweak this class in various ways in order to optimize its
  performance. \endverbatim
  Similarly advanced methods should be marked with
  \verbatim
  \advancedmethod\endverbatim
  To produce \advancedmethod.

- General warning messages can be produced using
  \verbatim
  \warning Be afraid, be very afraid.\endverbatim
  which produces
  \warning Be afraid, be very afraid.
    
- To mark that some part of the API has not yet been well planned at may change
    using \c \\unstable{Classname}. The documentation will include a disclaimer
    and the class or function will be added to a list of unstable classes. It is
    better to simply hide such things from \doxygen.

- To mark a method as not having been well tested yet, use \c \\untested{Classname}.

- To mark a method as not having been implemented, use \c \\untested{Classname}.

- To note that a class supports comparisons (eg <, >, ==, != etc) use \c \\comparable
  and then hide the comparison functions from \doxygen (there are a lot of them and they
  aren't very interesting).


\section scoring Scoring

Restraints take the current conformation of the particles and return a score and, if requested, add to the derivatives of each of the particles used. Evaluation can be done each of two ways
- whole model, where each of the particles is assumed to have changed and
- incremental, where only a few of the particles are assumed to have changed.
Efficiently supporting incremental evaluation requires extra work, but any restraint which implements Restraint::do_evaluate() will produce correct results.

In whole model evaluation, each restraint is called one at a time and given a change to computes its score based on the current conformation of the particles and adds to each particles derivatives. That is, if \f$R(P_i)\f$ is the score of the restraint on particle conformation \f$i\f$ and \f$R'(P_i)\f$ and there are no other restraints:
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td><b>Stage</b></td>
<td><b>Score for R</b></td>
<td><b>Particle attribute</b></td>
<td><b>Particle derivative</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>before model evaluation</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>\f$P_0\f$</td>
<td>undefined</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>before restraint evaluation</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>\f$P_0\f$</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>after restraint evaluation</td>
<td>\f$R(P_0)\f$</td>
<td>\f$P_0\f$</td>
<td>\f$R'(P_0)\f$</td>
</tr>
</table>

Incremental evaluation is more complicated. The model first sets up for incremental evaluation by creating a shadow particle for each real particle. The "prechange" particles have all the same attributes and values as the particle from the last time step. They are accessed using IMP::Particle::get_prechange_particle().

    During incremental evaluation in the model
    -# the derivatives are cleared on all the particles (but not the prechange particles)
    -# incremental restraints are evaluated. They need to make sure that the the change in the sum of the particle and prechange particle derivatives is equal to the change in derivatives and that the actual score is returned.
    -# derivatives are added to the prechange derivatives and then cleared
    -# the non-incremental restraints are then evaluated
    -# the derivatives of the prechange particles are added to the particle derivatives
    -# after scoring, all the particles are marked as clean and prechange particles are updated to reflect the current attributes of the particles

To put it another way
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td><b>Stage</b></td>
<td><b>Score for R</b></td>
<td><b>Particle attribute</b></td>
<td><b>Particle derivative</b></td>
<td><b>Prechange particle attribute</b></td>
<td><b>Prechange particle derivative</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>at start of first incremental model evaluation</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>\f$P_0\f$</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>undefined</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>at start of first restraint evaluation (non-incremental function called)</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>\f$P_0\f$</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>undefined</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>at end of first restraint evaluation (non-incremental function called on incremental restraint)</td>
<td>\f$R(P_0)\f$</td>
<td>\f$P_0\f$</td>
<td>\f$R'(P_0)\f$</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>undefined</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>at end of first model evaluation</td>
<td>\f$R(P_0)\f$</td>
<td>\f$P_0\f$</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>\f$P_0\f$</td>
<td>\f$R'(P_0)\f$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>at start of second model evaluation</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>\f$P_1\f$</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>\f$P_0\f$</td>
<td>\f$R'(P_0)\f$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>at start of second restraint evaluation (incremental called)</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>\f$P_1\f$</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>\f$P_0\f$</td>
<td>\f$R'(P_0)\f$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>at end of second restraint evaluation (incremental called)</td>
<td>\f$R(P_1)\f$</td>
<td>\f$P_1\f$</td>
<td>\f$R'(P_1)\f$</td>
<td>\f$P_0\f$</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>at end of second model evaluation</td>
<td>\f$R(P_1)\f$</td>
<td>\f$P_1\f$</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>\f$P_1\f$</td>
<td>\f$R'(P_1)\f$</td>
</tr>
</table>
Note that the restraints is free to put anything into to particle derivative and the prechange derivative as long as the sum is \f$R'(P_i)\f$. Particularly, if the derivative has not changed, it does not have to touch either of the derivatives.

    A IMP::Restraint is an incremental restraint if IMP::Restraint::get_is_incremental() returns true. For such restraints,
    IMP::Restraint::incremental_evaluate() is called instead of IMP::Restraint::evaluate(). \imp restraints which implement incremental evaluation tend to do it by:
 - for each term in the restraint, check if the involved particles have changed by calling IMP::Particle::get_is_changed().
 - if they have not, return a saved score from the last evaluate call
 - if the particles have changed, compute the score on the particles with the provided IMP::DerivativeAccumulator. Then compute the score on the prechange particles (they are also IMP::Particle objects, return by IMP::Particle::get_prechange_particle()), using an IMP::DerivativeAccumulator with negative the weight of the passed accumulator.


    Whenever a particle is changed is marked as dirty, so that returns true.

    A (perhaps partial) list of classes which benefit from incremental evaluation is:
    - IMP::core::IncrementalBallMover
    - all the optimizers/samplers


\section examples Writing Examples

Writing examples is very important part of being an \imp developer and
one of the best ways to help people use your code. To write a (Python)
example, create a file \c myexample.py in the example directory of an
appropriate module, along with a file \c myexample.readme. The readme
should provide a brief overview of what the code in the module is
trying to accomplish as well as key pieces of \imp functionality that
it uses.

When writing examples, one should try (as appropriate) to do the following:
-# begin the example with \c import lines for the \imp modules used
-# have parameters describing the process taking place. These include names of PDB files, the resolution to perform computations at etc.
-# define a function \c create_representating which creates and returns the model with the needed particles along with a data structure so that key particles can be located. It should define nested functions as needed to encapsulate commonly used code
-# define a function \c create_restraints which creates the  restraints to score conformations of the representation
-# define a function \c get_conformations to perform the sampling
-# define a function \c analyze_conformations to perform some sort of clustering and analysis of the resulting conformations
-# finally do the actual work of calling the \c create_representation and \c create_restraints functions and performing samping and analysis and displaying the solutions.

Obvious, not all examples need all of the above parts. See \ref nup84_cg "Nup84 CG" for an canonical example. 

The example should have enough comments that the reasoning behind each line of code is clear to someone who roughly understands how \imp in general works.


\section scripts Useful Scripts

\imp provides a variety of scripts to aid the lives of developers.

    \subsection make_scons Generate SConscripts
    The \c SConscripts in a number of the modules list all of the
    header and \c cpp files which are part of the module (those of other
    modules automatically build this list at compile time). These lists can
    be generated using the \c make-sconscripts script. To run it to rebuild
    the SConscripts for the module modulename do
    \command{./tools/make-sconscripts modulename}

    \subsection make_module Making a module

    Creating such a module is the easiest way to get started
    developing code for \imp. First, choose a name for the module.
    The name should only contain letters, numbers and underscores as it
    needs to be a valid file name as well as an identifier in Python and C++.

    To create the module do
    \command{./tools/make-module my_module}
    Then, if you run \c scons with \c localmodules=True, your new module will be
    built. The new module includes a number of examples and comments to help
    you add code to the module.

    You can use your new module in a variety of ways:
    - add C++ code to your module by putting \string{.h} files
      in \string{modules/my_module/include} and \string{.cpp} files in
      \string{modules/my_module/src}. In order to use use your new functions and
      classes in Python, you must add a line 
      \string{%include "IMP/my_module/myheader.h"} near the end of the file
      \string{modules/my_module/pyext/my_module.i}.
    - write C++ programs using \imp by creating \string{.cpp} files in
      \string{modules/my_module/bin}. Each \string{.cpp} file placed there
      is built into a separate executable.
    - add Python code to your library by putting a \string{.py} file in
      \string{modules/my_module/pyext/my_module/}
    - add Python code to your library by by adding
      \string{%pythoncode} blocks to \string{modules/my_module/pyext/my_module.i}.
    - add test code to your library by putting \string{.py} files in
      \string{modules/my_module/test} or a subdirectory.

    If you feel your module is of interest to other \imp users and 
    developers, see the \ref anchorcontributing "contributing code to IMP" section.

    If you document your code, running \command{scons doc} will build
    documentation of all of the modules including yours. To access the
    documentation, open \string{doc/html/index.html}.



\section contributing Contributing code back to the repository
\anchor anchorcontributing

In order to be shared with others as part of the \imp distribution,
code needs to be of higher quality and more thoroughly vetted than
typical research code. As a result, it may make sense to keep the
code as part of a private module until you better understand what
capabilities can be cleanly offered to others.

The first set of questions to answer are

- What exactly is the functionality I would like to contribute? Is
  it a single function, a single Restraint, a set of related classes
  and functions?

- Is there similar functionality already in \imp? If so, it might make
  more sense to modify the existing code in cooperation with its
  author. At the very least, the new code needs to respect the
  conventions established by the prior code in order to maintain
  consistency.

- Where should the new functionality go? It can either be added to an
  existing module or as part of a new module. If adding to an existing
  module, you must communicate with the authors of that module to get
  permission and coordinate changes.

- Should the functionality be written in C++ or Python? In general, we
  suggest C++ if you are comfortable programming in that language as
  that makes the functionality available to more people. See
  \ref cpppythondifferences "Python/C++ differences" for more considerations.

You are encouraged to post to the
\impdev to find help
answering these questions as it can be hard to grasp all the various
pieces of functionality already in the repository.

All code contributed to \imp
- must follow the  \ref codingconventions "IMP coding conventions"
- should follow general good \ref cpp "C++ programming practices"
- must have unit tests
- must pass all unit tests
- must have documentation
- must build on all supported compilers (roughly, recent versions of gcc and Visual C++) without warnings
- should have examples
- must not have warnings when \doxygen is run (\c scons \c doc)

The next suggestions provide more details about the above choices and how to implement them.

\subsection submitting Submitting to a module

Small pieces of functionality or extensions to existing functionality
probably should be submitted to an existing module. Please contact the
authors of the appropriate module and discuss the submission and how
the code will be maintained.

A list of all current modules in the \impsvn can be found in
<a href="namespaces.html">the modules list</a> or from the modules tab
at the top of this page.

As always, if in doubt, post to \impdev.

Patches to modules for which you have write access can be submitted
directly by doing:
\command{svn commit -m "message describing the patch" files or directories to submit}




\subsection submitting Submitting a module

If you have a large group of related functionality to submit, it may make sense to create a new module in svn. Please post to \impdev to discuss your plans.


\subsection submitted Once you have submitted code

Once you have submitted code, you should monitor the
\salilab{imp/nightly/tests.html,Nightly build status} to make sure that
your code builds on all platforms and passes the unit tests. Please
fix all build problems as fast as possible.

The following sorts of changes must be announced on the \impdev
mailing list before being made
 - changes to existing kernel or core APIs
 - significant additions to kernel or core

We recommend that changes be posted to the list a day or two before
they are made so as to give everyone adequate time to comment.

In addition to monitoring the \impdev list, developers who have a module or
are committing patches to svn may want to subscribe to the \impcommits email
list which receives notices of all changes made to the \imp SVN repository.


\section crossplatform Cross platform compatibility

\imp is designed to run on a wide variety of platforms. To detect problems on
other platforms
we provide \salilab{imp/nightly/tests.html,nightly test runs} on the supported
platforms for code that is part of the \imp SVN repository.

In order to make it more likely that your code works on all the supported platforms:
- use the headers and classes in IMP::compatibility when appropriate
- avoid the use of \c and and \c or in C++ code, use \c && and \c || instead.
- avoid \c friend declarations involving templates, use \c #if blocks
  on \c SWIG and \c IMP_DOXYGEN to hide code as needed instead.

\section cpp Good programming practices

The contents of this page are aimed at C++ programmers, but most apply
also to Python.

\subsection coding General resources

Two excellent sources for general C++ coding guidelines are

    - \external{http://www.amazon.com/Coding-Standards-Rules-Guidelines-Practices/dp/0321113586, C++ Coding Standards} by Sutter and Alexandrescu

    - \external{http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Specific-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0201924889, Effective C++} by Meyers

\imp endeavors to follow all the of the guidelines published in those
books. The Sali lab owns copies of both of these books that you
are free to borrow.



\subsection impcoding IMP gotchas
    
Below are a suggestions prompted by bugs found in code submitted to \imp.

- Never use '\c using \c namespace' outside of a function; instead 
      explicitly provide the namespace. (This avoids namespace pollution, and
      removes any ambiguity.)

- Never use the preprocessor to define constants. Use \c const
  variables instead. Preprocessor symbols don't have scope or type
  and so can have unexpected effects.

- Don't expect names to be unique, they are there for human viewing. If
  you need a unique identifier associated with an object or non-geometric
  value, just use the object or value itself.

    - Pass other objects by value or by \c const & (if the object is
      large) and store copies of them.

    - Never expose member variables in an object which has
      methods. All such member variables should be private.

    - Don't derive a class from another class simply to reuse some
      code that the base class provides - only do so if your derived
      class could make sense when cast to the base class. As above,
      reuse existing code by pulling it into a function.

    - Clearly mark any file that is created by a script so that other
      people know to edit the original file.

    - Always return a \c const value or \c const ref if you are not
      providing write access. Returning a \c const copy means the
      compiler will report an error if the caller tries to modify the
      return value without creating a copy of it.

    - Include files from the local module first, then files from the
    other \imp modules and kernel and finally outside includes. This
    makes any dependencies in your code obvious, and by including
    standard headers \e after \imp headers, any missing includes in the
    headers themselves show up early (rather than being masked by
    other headers you include).

    \code
    #include <IMP/mymodule/mymodule_exports.h>
    #include <IMP/mymodule/MyRestraint.h>
    #include <IMP/Restraint.h>
    #include <vector>
    \endcode

    - Use \c double variables for all computational intermediates.

    - Avoid using nested classes in the API as SWIG can't wrap them
      properly.  If you must use use nested classes, you will have to
      do more work to provide a Python interface to your code.


    - Delay initialization of keys until they are actually needed
      (since all initialized keys take up memory within each particle,
      more or less). The best way to do this is to have them be static
      variables in a static function:
      \code
      FloatKey get_my_float_key() {
               static FloatKey k("hello");
               return k;
      }
      \endcode

    - One is the almost always the right number:
        - Information should be stored in exactly one
          place. Duplicated information easily gets out of sync.
        - A given piece of code should only appear once. Do not copy,
          paste and modify to create new functionality.  Instead,
          figure out a way to reuse the existing code by pulling it
          into an internal function and adding extra parameters. If
          you don't, when you find bugs, you won't remember to fix
          them in all the copies of the code.
        - There should be exactly one way to represent any particular
          state. If there is more than one way, anyone who writes
          library code which uses that type of state has to handle all
          ways.  For %example, there is only one scheme for
          representing proteins, namely the IMP::atom::Hierarchy.       
        - Each class/method should do exactly one thing. The presence
          of arguments which dramatically change the behavior of the
          class/method is a sign that it should be split. Splitting
          it can make the code simpler, expose the common code for
          others to use and make it harder to make mistakes by
          getting the mode flag wrong.
        - Methods should take at most one argument of each type (and
          ideally only one argument). If there are several arguments
          of the same types (eg two different \c double parameters) it is
          easy for a user to mix up the order of arguments and the compiler will
          not complain. \c int and \c double count as
          equivalent types for this rule since the compiler will
          transparently convert an \c int into a \c double.


\section swig Exporting code to Python

\imp uses SWIG to wrap code C++ code and export it to Python. Since SWIG is
relatively complicated, we provide a number of helper macros and an example
file (see modules/example/pyext/swig.i-in). The key bits are
- the information goes into a file called swig.i-in in the module pyext directory
- the first part should be one \c IMP_SWIG_VALUE(), \c IMP_SWIG_OBJECT() or
  \c IMP_SWIG_DECORATOR() line per value type, object type or decorator object
  the module exports to Python. Each of these lines looks like
  \code
  IMP_SWIG_VALUE(IMP::module_namespace, ClassName, ClassNames);
  \endcode
- then there should be a number of \c %include lines, one per header file
  in the module which exports a class or function to Python. The header files
  must be in order such that no class is used before a declaration for it
  is encountered (SWIG does not search \c #include files for the \c %include headers)
- finally, any templates that are to be exported to SWIG must have a
  \c %template call. It should look something like
  \code
  namespace IMP {
    namespace module_namespace {
       %template(PythonName) CPPName<Restraint, 3>;
    }
  }
  \endcode
