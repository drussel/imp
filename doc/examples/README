Our examples are divided into three categories:
- \ref simple_examples "Simple examples", which demonstrate a single class or decorator
- \ref large_examples "Large examples" which demonstrate a variety of classes working together
- \ref fragments "Fragments" which are little bits of code that illustrate using a particular function.
