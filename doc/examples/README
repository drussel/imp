Our examples are divided into three categories:
- \ref simple_examples "Simple examples", which demonstrate a single class or decorator
- \ref using_experimental_data "Experimental examples" which demonstrate a variety of classes working together to go from experimental data to a structure
- \ref fragments "Fragments" which are little bits of code that illustrate using a particular piece of \imp but can't be run on their own.
- \ref implementation "Implementation Examples" which illustrate how to add new Restraints, Decorators etc. to \IMP.
