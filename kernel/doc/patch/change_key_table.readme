move the key table into a state variable in a function now that I am not
trying to do fancy template stuff any more. This removes the initialization
problems since you can only get the table by calling the function and it will
be initialized the first time the function is called. As a result, keys can be
statically initialized. This is still a bad thing to do in general, but for
Residue and Atom types this is a good thing.
