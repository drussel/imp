/**
  \mainpage IMP Internal API reference
  
   This page is the main page for the internal \imp documentation. This
   documentation should be used by developers of \imp modules as it includes
   documentation of the \c .cpp files as well as the internal and static
   namespaces. You probably want the API documentation instead, unless you
   know what you are doing.
