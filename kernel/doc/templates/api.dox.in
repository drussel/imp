  \section intro Introduction
  
    This is the API reference for \imp, an Integrative Modeling Platform. If you are
    new to \imp, you should familiarize yourself with the following pages first:
    - \ref decorators "Using Decorators"
    - \ref log "Logging Support"
    - \ref assert "Error Reporting Facilities"
    - \ref deprecation "Deprecated Functionality"

    Then look through the examples which can be found at:
    - \ref Examples "Examples"

    There are a variety of useful base classes which are used to provide
    most functionality. They are:
    - IMP::Model
    - IMP::Particle
    - IMP::Restraint
    - IMP::ScoreState
    - IMP::Optimizer
    - IMP::core::SingletonContainer, IMP::core::PairContainer
    - IMP::SingletonScore, IMP::PairScore, IMP::TripletScore
    - IMP::core::SingletonModifier, IMP::core::PairModifier, IMP::core::TripletModifier

    When programming with \imp, one of the more useful pages is the
    <a href="hierarchy.html">class hierarchy</a> as well as the module main
    pages:
    - IMP
    - IMP::core
    - IMP::misc
    - IMP::em
    - IMP::domino
    - IMP::saxs

    \note The 'Modules' tab has nothing to do with modules in IMP. The entries in the
    tab are groups of functionality which can cut across modules.
