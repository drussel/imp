  \mainpage IMP API reference
  
  \section intro Introduction
  
    This is the API reference for \imp, an Integrative Modeling Platform. If you are
    new to \imp, you should familiarize yourself with the following pages first:
    - \ref introduction "An Introduction to IMP"
    - \ref decorators "Using Decorators"
    - \ref coding_conventions "IMP Coding Conventions"
    - \ref log "Logging Support"
    - \ref assert "Error Reporting Facilities"

    Then look through the examples which can be found at:
    - \ref Examples "Examples"

    There are a variety of useful base classes which are used to provide
    most functionality. They are:
    - IMP::Model
    - IMP::Particle
    - IMP::Restraint
    - IMP::ScoreState
    - IMP::Optimizer
    - IMP::core::SingletonContainer, IMP::core::PairContainer
    - IMP::SingletonScore, IMP::PairScore, IMP::TripletScore
    - IMP::core::SingletonModifier, IMP::core::PairModifier, IMP::core::TripletModifier

    When programming with \imp, one of the more useful pages is the
    <a href="hierarchy.html">class hierarchy</a> as well as the module main
    pages:
    - \ref impcore "IMP.core"
    - \ref impmisc "IMP.misc"

    and finally

    - the <a href="https://salilab.org/imp/wiki/front_page/">IMP wiki page</a>

    \note The 'Modules' tab has nothing to do with modules in IMP. The entries in the
    tab are groups of functionality which can cut across modules.
