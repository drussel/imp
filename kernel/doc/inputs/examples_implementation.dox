/**\page implementation Implementation

These C++ examples show how to implement instances of Restraints, ScoreStates, Decorators
and other basic types that should not be implemented in python.

\section decorator Decorator

This decorator allows you to add and control a name in a Particle.

\include decorator.cpp

\section restraint Restraint

Implement a simple restraint which applies a PairScore to each ParticlePair in a ParticleContainer.

\include restraint.cpp
