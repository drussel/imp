  \section intro Introduction
  
    This is the API reference for \imp, an Integrative Modeling Platform.
    If you are new to \imp, you should familiarize yourself with the following
    pages first:
    - \ref decorators "Using Decorators"
    - \ref log "Logging Support"
    - \ref assert "Error Reporting Facilities"
    - \salilab{imp/doc/doxygen/deprecated.html, Deprecated Functionality}

    Then look through the examples which can be found at:
    - \ref examples "Examples"

    There are a variety of useful base classes which are used to provide
    most functionality. They are:
    - IMP::Model
    - IMP::Particle
    - IMP::Decorator
    - IMP::Restraint
    - IMP::ScoreState
    - IMP::Optimizer
    - IMP::SingletonContainer, IMP::PairContainer
    - IMP::SingletonScore, IMP::PairScore, IMP::TripletScore
    - IMP::SingletonModifier, IMP::PairModifier

    There are a few blocks of functionality that cut across modules. They
    include
    - \ref hierarchy "Code to create and manipulate hierarchies"
    - \ref bond "Code to create and manipulate bonds"

    When programming with \imp, one of the more useful pages is the
    <a href="hierarchy.html">class hierarchy</a> as well as
    the \salilab{imp/doc/doxygen/namespaces.html, module pages}.*/
