    Models can be written to files in an easy-to-read
    file format based on \quote{name: value} pairs on separate lines with
    indentation used to indicated nesting (as in Python). The functions
    take a list of the particles to write/read. The particles
    need to be provided in the same order for reading and writing.
    This is not checked.

    The files should have the suffix ".imp".

    If a passed particle has a particle attribute which is a particle
    not in the list, an IOException is thrown. This can change to
    silently ignoring such attributes if desired.

    If a list of attributes is passed to read or write, only those
    attributes are read.

    \note If you are just interested in saving the state of a model during
    runtime, use an IMP::ConfigurationSet instead. It should be
    substantially faster.

/** \name Binary I/O

    When lots of data is being written, it can be useful to write the
    data as binary instead of text. Binary writing requires NetCDF.

    The files should have the suffix ".impb".

    For writing if the append is true is a positive integer, then
    the data is added to the file if it already exists.

    For reading, and IOException will be thrown if an invalid frame
    is requested. Frames are always sequential.

    \note Not all particles need to have all the attributes,
    missing attributes will be skipped. However, the set of attributes
    must match on the write and read particles.

    \note These methods should be considered unstable. Use the text
    IO if you want stable long term storage.

    \note Not all particles need to have all the attributes,

    \note There is no handling of architectural issues. That is, this
    is only guaranteed to work if it is read and written on the same
    operating system and system bit length. We could probably fix this.

    \note both these methods should be considered unstable.
