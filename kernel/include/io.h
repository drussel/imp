/** \name Model IO

    Models can be written to files in an easy-to-read
    file format based on \quoted{name: value} pairs on separate lines with
    indentation used to indicated nesting (as in python). The functions
    take a list of the particles to write/read. The particles
    need to be provided in the same order for reading and writing.
    This is not checked.

    If a passed particle has a particle attribute which is a particle
    not in the list, an IOException is thrown. This can change to
    silently ignoring such attributes if desired.

    \note If you are just interested in saving the state of a model during
    runtime, use an IMP::ConfigurationSet instead. It should be
    substantially faster.
