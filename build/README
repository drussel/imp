Files under this directory (even pure Python modules) are built from sources
elsewhere within IMP. Do not edit them here - any changes you make will be
overwritten!

The lib directory contains Python modules (both pure Python, in the IMP
subdirectory, and C++ extensions, as _IMP_foo.so in the top-level directory)
and the IMP C++ libraries (as libimp_foo.so in the top-level directory).
Rationale: Windows searches for C++ dynamic libraries in the same directory
as C++ Python extensions.

The include directory contains all public header files under the IMP
subdirectory. Modules are in named subdirectories under that.
