The files in this directory are used to test an installed version of IMP
(unlike other test scripts, which test *this* copy of IMP) to make sure it
can be linked against, and used from Python.

To run the tests, type 'scons' in this directory. You will probably need
to give scons some parameters to tell it where your copy of IMP is
installed ('scons -h'). For example,

scons libpath='/home/IMP/lib' cpppath='/home/IMP/include' \
      pypath='/home/IMP/python' python='python2.5'
