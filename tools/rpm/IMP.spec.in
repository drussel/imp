# RHEL doesn't have a CGAL package, so build without CGAL on RHEL. It also
# doesn't have a new enough OpenCV in EPEL, or bullet or eigen packages, so
# disable em2d, bullet and isd modules.
# on Fedora, all of these packages are available; add them as dependencies

%description
IMP's broad goal is to contribute to a comprehensive structural
characterization of biomolecules ranging in size and complexity from small
peptides to large macromolecular assemblies. Detailed structural
characterization of assemblies is generally impossible by any single existing
experimental or computational method. This barrier can be overcome by hybrid
approaches that integrate data from diverse biochemical and biophysical
experiments (eg, x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy,
immuno-electron microscopy, footprinting, chemical cross-linking, FRET
spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, immunoprecipitation, genetic
interactions, etc...).

We formulate the hybrid approach to structure determination as an optimization
problem, the solution of which requires three main components:
    * the representation of the assembly,
    * the scoring function and
    * the optimization method.

The ensemble of solutions to the optimization problem embodies the most
accurate structural characterization given the available information.

We created IMP, the Integrative Modeling Platform, to make it easier to
implement such an integrative approach to structural and dynamics problems.
IMP is designed to allow mixing and matching of existing modeling components
as well as easy addition of new functionality.

# Note that we currently don't include the documentation in the RPM, since
#      a) it takes a long time to run doxygen
#      b) doxygen isn't installed on all of our build systems
#      c) it is really big
#  and d) only certain versions of doxygen work correctly
# You can build the documentation by running, in the IMP source tree:
# scons dot=True destdir=/tmp docdir=/usr/share/doc/imp-%{version} doc-install
