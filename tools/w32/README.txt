The installer will install IMP under a directory of your choosing.
For example, the FoXS fitting program is installed in the 'bin' subdirectory,
so can be run simply by opening a Command Prompt, changing to this bin
directory (or adding it to your PATH), and typing 'foxs'.

The IMP Python libraries are automatically set up to work with any version
of Python from 2.4 to 2.7. (You need to download Python separately from
www.python.org and install it.) One easy way to run IMP Python scripts is
to open them in Python's IDLE program and run them by pressing F5.
