Elaborate documentation and an installation guide can be found at
http://salilab.org/imp/doc.html (stable, well-tested release)
http://salilab.org/imp/nightly/doc/html (unstable, nightly build)

Common build options:
=====================

* To build and install IMP to a specified folder do:

  scons prefix=path_to_install install

* Build IMP within the ./build folder

  scons all

* Build IMP in fast mode (no internal checks, less meaninfgul error messages,
  but fastest runs)

  scons all build='fast'

* Build a specific module (e.g., em2d):

  scons <module name>

* To build the documentation to IMP.

    scons doc

   You can access the documentation by opening doc/html/index.html

Files and folders structure:
============================

Files under the build directory (even pure Python modules) are built from sources
elsewhere within IMP. Do not edit them there - any changes you make will be
overwritten! You should also not add any files to these directories, as they
will be deleted.

The lib directory contains Python modules (both pure Python, in the IMP
subdirectory, and C++ extensions, as _IMP_foo.so in the top-level directory)
and the IMP C++ libraries (as libimp_foo.so in the top-level directory).
Rationale: Windows searches for C++ dynamic libraries in the same directory
as C++ Python extensions.

The include directory contains all public header files under the IMP
subdirectory. Modules are in named subdirectories under that.

The swig directory contains all SWIG interface (.i) files used to build
the Python interface.
