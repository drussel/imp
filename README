Building IMP:
=====================

To build IMP source found in `imp-source` and install it in `path_to_install` do:

      1. `cmake path/to/imp-source -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_install`
      2. `make -j 8`

Run `ccmake` to see more variables that can be used to customize your build and
install.

To run IMP without installing, build imp and then use `setup_environment.sh` to
set the required environment variables. For example, to run `ligand_score`, do
`./setup_environment.sh ligand_score arguments...`, or
`./setup_environment.sh $SHELL` and then `ligand_score arguments...` in the
new shell.

See https://github.com/salilab/imp/wiki/Cmake for more information on building
with cmake.

Files and folders structure:
============================

The lib directory contains Python modules (both pure Python, in the IMP
subdirectory, and C++ extensions, as _IMP_foo.so in the top-level directory)
and the IMP C++ libraries (as libimp_foo.so in the top-level directory).
Rationale: Windows searches for C++ dynamic libraries in the same directory
as C++ Python extensions.

The include directory contains all public header files under the IMP
subdirectory. Modules are in named subdirectories under that.

The swig directory contains all SWIG interface (.i) files used to build
the Python interface.
