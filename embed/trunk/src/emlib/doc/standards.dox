/**
  \page standards EMBED Coding Standards

  To ensure code consistency and readability, and clean SVN checkins, certain
  conventions should be adhered to when writing EMBED code. For consistency,
  EMBED uses the same coding standards as IMP, which are documented in
  the <a href="https://salilab.org/imp/doc/ch01s03.html">IMP manual</a>.

  To check the code against some of the coding standards, run 'scons standards'.
